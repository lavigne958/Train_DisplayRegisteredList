# Train_DisplayRegisteredList

this app ha no final purpose, it is only here for me to practice and you to have an example if you need.

I am trying to read informations from a csv/tsv file and display those informations in QTreeWidge (which my final purpos, use, practice on QTreeWdiget). It will load a csv file and ask for the order of the headers. From that il will read the line and take the order from the modal to take as first level of the tree the first header in the list and so on.

The app has no design, d'ont need to when you only need to be practicle.

The app read from a tsv file for the moment, the index of the value to put in the competitor object is set in the enum so it can be adapted.
Fields as well can be adapted (Name, Weight, Level, ...)

Enjoy if you need an example of how to use QTreeWidget.
